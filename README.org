* Keybinds
  Below is a table of the keybinds I try and maintain, note that a
  "H-" prefix indicates the hyper key.

  | Key Sequence | Action                                     |
  |--------------+--------------------------------------------|
  | H-a          | Tile to the left half of the screen        |
  | H-o          | Maximise window under cursor               |
  | H-e          | Tile to the right half of the screen       |
  | H-;          | Tile to the left two-thirds of the screen  |
  | H-,          | Tile to the right two-thirds of the screen |
  | H-.          | Tile to the leftmost third of the screen   |
  | H-p          | Tile the the middle third of the screen    |
  | H-y          | Tile to the rightmost third of the screen  |
  | H-<RET>      | Fullscreen window under cursor             |
  | M-<RET>      | Open a terminal                            |
  |--------------+--------------------------------------------|
Note that these are global-bindings not application-specific bindings,
application specific bindings may vary.
